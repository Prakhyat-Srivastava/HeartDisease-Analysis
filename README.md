# Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

# Technologies - Business Intelligence

# Domain - Healthcare

# Project Difficulties level - Advanced

# Problem Statement:
Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical data for better future preparation.

Do ETL : Extract- Transform and Load data from heart disease diagnostic database
You can perform EDA through python.
From the database extract various information such as Heart disease rates, Heart disease by gender, by age.

You can even compare attributes of the data set to extract necessary information. Make necessary dashboard with the best you can extract from the data. Use various visualization and features and make the best dashboard.

## Overview
In this project, we delve into the intricate world of healthcare analytics, focusing on heart disease diagnostics. Leveraging the power of data analysis and visualization techniques, we unlock insights from multivariate clinical data collected from four renowned medical institutions.

## Data Extraction
We began by extracting data from a comprehensive zip archive containing multiple databases, emphasizing the meticulous preservation of data integrity throughout the extraction process.

## Data Cleaning
Our data preparation phase involved a careful examination of missing values, outlier detection, and normalization of categorical variables, ensuring the data's accuracy and consistency for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Through a series of EDA steps, we:
- Reviewed the initial structure of the dataset to understand the features at our disposal.
- Conducted univariate analysis to observe individual feature distributions.
- Engaged in bivariate analysis, revealing relationships between features and heart disease occurrence.
- Performed boxplot analysis to identify and handle outliers, preserving the statistical robustness of our dataset.

## Visualization Mastery
We brought data to life through an array of visual representations:
- **Pie Charts**: Illustrated the proportion of individuals with and without heart disease.
- **Countplots and Bar Plots**: Revealed demographic distributions and medical indicators like cholesterol levels and resting blood pressure across gender and age categories.
- **Swarm Plots**: Provided a nuanced view of age distributions by gender without overlapping data points.
- **Line Plots**: Traced the relationship of continuous variables such as cholesterol and ST depression over age, underscoring the trend of risk factors as patients age.

## Key Findings
Our analysis concluded that:
- A significant percentage of the population sampled is affected by heart disease.
- Cholesterol levels and blood pressure readings have a marked influence on heart disease presence.
- Age and gender are pivotal factors in the manifestation and diagnosis of heart disease symptoms.


## Conclusion
The intersection of data science and healthcare continues to show promise in diagnosing and understanding chronic diseases. This project exemplifies how data analysis can pave the way for informed healthcare decisions and strategic medical interventions.
